Project 3 - Instagrid

Description and Requirements
For Project 3, you’re going to create a one-page, responsive website that allows a user to search for a hashtag via the Instagram API.

Your project must:
Dynamically fetch photos and populate them in a webpage via the Instagram API based a text string input into a search field
Link each returned image to its URL on Instagram (unless undertaking lightbox stretch goal)
General requirements:

Your project must:
Contain a single .html file and an external .css file (a CSS reset may be included separately)
Adequately reflect the designer’s vision for the website when built out using HTML & CSS
Demonstrate effective organization of the project’s root directory
Have a Git repository initialized in its root directory
Be pushed to GitHub (with all of your commits synced to it)
Use Gulp for running build tasks, such as minification and error checking

Your project must:
Make appropriate use of classes and IDs as selectors
Use a CSS reset
Use Sass as a preprocessor, with CSS properly compiled and minified
Use the background property where appropriate
Implement a mobile-first responsive layout using Flexbox (no floats)
Demonstrate effective use of box model properties
Demonstrate effective use of CSS properties for altering the visual display of text (e.g. font-family, font-style, text-transform, etc.)
Incorporate custom fonts using @font-face
Use an icon font

Your project must:
Use Ajax to fetch data from an Instagram API endpoint
Transition users between UI states, starting where no photos have been returned, and then subsequently transitioning where photos populate the grid (incorporating a loading gif)

Your project must:
Be responsively designed using a mobile-first approach
Be optimized for 3 screen sizes: mobile, min-width: 600px, and min-width: 1000px

Stretch goals:
Incorporate pagination and fetch additional photos via the Instagram API when the “Load More” button is clicked
Incorporate a lightbox plugin to display images in their largest format if a user clicks on them

Experience gained:
Flexbox is so much easier to use than floats! However, the tricky part is to figure the proper divs/containers to make them work. Fetching photos from the Instagram API with Ajax was a great experience. Learning the exact paths and using them in Javascript was a bit tricky but good learning experience. First project to use sass and browser-sync. Great tools to help with development. Although there wasn't much HTML, there was a lot of Javascripting and took a while to figure out. Learning Git repository was invaluable as I used to rely on OneDrive to keep a backup copy and able to work on other machines. Version control also came in very handy.

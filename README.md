**Summary:**

A one-page responsive website that allows a user to search for a hashtag via the Instagram API. Once the images are fetched, it is display nicely in a grid format.


**Tools and methods used to build site:**

- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- Ajax request from Instagram API
- jQuery
- Lightbox plugin
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Gulp, SASS, Autoprefixer, Browser-Sync
- Git and GitHub


**Experience from the project:**

Flexbox is so much easier to use than floats! However, the tricky part is to figure the proper divs/containers to make them work. Fetching photos from the Instagram API with Ajax was a great experience. Learning the exact paths and using them in Javascript was a bit tricky but good learning experience. First project to use sass and browser-sync. Great tools to help with development. Although there wasn't much HTML, there was a lot of Javascripting and took a while to figure out. Learning Git repository was invaluable as I used to rely on OneDrive to keep a backup copy and able to work on other machines. Version control also came in very handy.
